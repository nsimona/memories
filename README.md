# Memories - MERN Stack Project

## Introduction

Memories is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack project created for fun. It serves as a personal starting point and exploration into Node.js programming within the context of the MERN stack. The goal of this project is to provide users with a platform to share and reminisce about their memories. The application allows users to add their memories through a simple form, and these memories are then displayed in a social media-like page. Users can interact with the memories by liking and saving them.

## Features

- **Add Memories:** Users can add their memories using a form, providing details such as the title, description, and an optional image.

- **Social Media-like Page:** Memories are displayed in a visually appealing format, similar to a social media page.

- **Interactions:** Users can like and save memories, adding a layer of interactivity to the platform.
